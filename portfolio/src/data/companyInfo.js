    description: 'Lambda School is a seven-month immersive full stack software development program working in a team environment. The first couple of months has to do with the front-end, learning how to develop beautiful applications with vanilla CSS then moving onto LESS all the way to styled components in React. With our training in vanilla JavaScript and ReactJS, we took time learning Redux for large scale application state management. Once we finished all that we moved into back-end development using Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, and Knex. Once we finished back-end, we moved into the Computer Science curriculum where we learned data structures and algorithms, Python, Django, C. After completing this section I am now able to write code solving problems with more time and space efficiency. '

In the Spring we then traveled to New York to visit the NYSE and talk to brokers on the trading floor.  `
